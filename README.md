# CodePath Coursework & Learning Repository

Welcome to my **CodePath Coursework & Learning Repository**! This repository contains all of my coursework, notes, projects, and learning materials from the CodePath courses. 

I’m using this space to:

- Document my growth as a developer
- Reinforce and review key programming concepts
- Publicly track my progress over time

Feel free to explore my projects and notes to see my journey in tech development.
